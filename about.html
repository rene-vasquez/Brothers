                <p>My name is Gregory Jacques, an Austin-ite who is a Westwood High School Warrior, and a Texas State Bobcat. I started working valet while enrolled in classes back in 2008. After graduating with a BA focused in Mass Communications, I partnered with Kyle Manley to create Brothers Valet back in 2014. </p>
                <p>While I do enjoy valeting - discounted meals, greeting guests and building relationships - my passion is creating art, furniture, and any tangible objects with any material I can get my hands on. I aspire to be an artist who uses the resources of the environment, to create art which reflects the culture.</p>

                <p class="fsize14">Kyle Manley was born and raised on a chain of lakes in Saint Cloud Florida and during his time there developed a love for fishing, camping, and any general exploration of new places. Over the years he traveled to many different states and countries allowing him to learn to relate to a variety of people.</p>
                <p class="fsize14">Having worked many customer service jobs Kyle cultivated a passion for taking care of people and through that passion finally came to work as a valet, finding an area he truly excelled, making it possible to create a viable business.</p>

                <p class="fsize14">Rascal is an 11 year old Alaskan Malamute mix. He grew up on a ranch in Wimberley, TX where he was able to roam free - chasing deer and hanging out with the neighbors.</p>
                <p class="fsize14">In his later years Rascal has slowed down a bit and developed an appreciation for the finer things in life. He can often be found during a work shift sleeping away an evening, getting his belly rubbed, or chowing down on a juicy filet mignon from Eddie V's. As an extremely friendly dog and a staple of our team, Rascal has been doing a great job greeting both guests and employees since he became a valet dog five years ago.</p>
